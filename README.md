# codeSwitchClassifier

The purpose of this project is to explore the use of LSTM models for the application of identifying code switching using the PyTorch library. The models generated by this project can be used take sentences given as an input, and make predictions for the language used for each individual word in the sentence.

The project implements two types of LSTM models, a single-layer LSTM model, which generates word embeddings from a given word vector, performs an LSTM cycle, and generates predictions for tags for each word in the sentence, and a double-layer LSTM model, which performs and LSTM cycle on the characters of each given word, and concatenates the final hidden state to the word embedding, and the 2nd LSTM process is performed using this concatenated tensor.

The results for different types of models can be test using the testModels function, which calculates and displays the accuracy rate for each generated model. Here is the output for the sample models included in this repo:

For defaultModelDoubleLSTM.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 8211, Success Rate 0.85889121338912  
For defaultModelDoubleLSTMepoch1.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 7272, Success Rate 0.76066945606694  
For defaultModelDoubleLSTMepoch2.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 7845, Success Rate 0.82060669456066  
For defaultModelDoubleLSTMepoch3.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 8106, Success Rate 0.8479079497907  
For defaultModelDoubleLSTMepoch4.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 8193, Success Rate 0.85700836820083  
For defaultModelSingleLSTM.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 6653, Success Rate 0.69592050209205  
For DoubleLSTMMonoDir.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 7635, Success Rate 0.79864016736401  
For SingleLSTMMonoDir.pt Final stats: Trials 9560, Unknown 0, Successes 7093, Success Rate 0.74194560669456  

The results show the learning rate of the model through each epoch, the effectiveness of bidirection LSTMs vs monodirectional, and the performance improvement gained from the double LSTM process vs the single LSTM process.
